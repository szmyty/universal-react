# .mailmap - Simplified mapping of author and committer names and email addresses
# https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmailmap
#
# This file is used to standardize author/committer names and email addresses in git history.
# The format is as follows:
#
# 1. Map a canonical name/email to an alternative name/email
#    Example: Correct Name <correct.email@example.com> <incorrect.email@example.com>
#
# 2. Map a canonical name/email to a name without an email
#    Example: Correct Name <correct.email@example.com> Name Without Email
#
# 3. Map a canonical name/email to a name and email without an email
#    Example: Correct Name <correct.email@example.com> Name Without Email <email@without.example.com>
#
# Below is a basic configuration for this project.
